# landing-page

https://adacott.github.io/landing-page/ -- Link to see the webpage.

This is the first webpage I have ever created -- a landing webpage that illustrates various skills in CSS, HTML, and most-importantly, the rigorous use of flex-box to position elements on a webpage.

Below is a reflection on the popular methods I saw other creators use, and the various issues with my page that if I were to redo this entire project, I would change. My main issues tldr is that I used rigid sizing for each section, and defined the body to be 100vb, thus ensuring from the start my webpage would be squished and improperly porportioned. I also underutilized flex-grow,shrink,and basis.
